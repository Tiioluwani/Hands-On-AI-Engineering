4.  **Audit**: The Agent reports what was found and what is still missing.
5.  **Conversation**: Fill in missing gaps or clarify information via the chat interface.
6.  **The Trigger**: Once details are complete, the user triggers the "Visual Auto-Fill".
7.  **Auto-Filling**: A cinematic live-action loop "paints" the PDF field-by-field.
8.  **Verification**: A high-resolution side-by-side audit of the Original vs. Filled PDF.
9.  **Export**: Download the finalized PDF or the raw JSON data registry.
